Read 'agents/nextjs.md' and 'agents/supabase.md'


Database location: Save all database changes/migrations to folder 'db'z

This Repo contains (or will) two react apps.
- catalog in folder 'catalog'
- admin in folder 'admin'

Both use same supabase database. Structure is stored in 'db' folder

Folder tasks contains my personal notes for prompts so you don't need to care about them

Both app are hosted on Vercel
