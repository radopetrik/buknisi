Read 'agents/nextjs.md' and 'agents/supabase.md'

Database location: Save all database changes/migrations to folder 'db'z

This repo contains (or will) two React apps. So it I tell do work on "admin" then look only to admin folder where is the app same for catalog:
- catalog in folder 'catalog'
- admin in folder 'admin' (Next.js 16 app with Tailwind/shadcn + Supabase auth)

Both use same Supabase database. Structure is stored in 'db' folder.

Folder 'tasks' contains personal notes for prompts—no need to modify.

Both apps are hosted on Vercel.
